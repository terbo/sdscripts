Analog Diffusion
  Filename: analog-diffusion-1.0.ckpt
  URL: https://huggingface.co/wavymulder/Analog-Diffusion
  Keywords: In your prompt, use the activation token: analog style
  Description:
    This is a dreambooth model trained on a diverse set of analog photographs.
    You may need to use the words blur haze naked in your negative prompts. My dataset did not include any NSFW material but the model seems to be pretty horny. Note that using blur and haze in your negative prompt can give a sharper image but also a less pronounced analog film effect

Anything V3
  Filename: Anything-V3.0-pruned-fp16.ckpt
  URL: https://huggingface.co/Linaqruf/anything-v3.0
  Keywords: see site
  Description:
    Welcome to Anything V3 - a latent diffusion model for weebs. This model is intended to produce high-quality, highly detailed anime style with just a few prompts. Like other anime-style Stable Diffusion models, it also supports danbooru tags to generate images.

Clayitization
  Filename: jakSClayitizationIma_clayitizationSd21768.ckpt (requires yaml)
  URL: https://civitai.com/models/1538/jaks-clayitization-image-pack
  Keywords: Use Prompt: "clayitization" in the beginning of your prompt followed by a word. 
  Description:
    From the makers of Woolitize, another versatile Jak Texture Pack is available to help unleash your Clay-itivity!

Clazy
  Filename: clazy_clazy2600.ckpt
  URL: https://civitai.com/models/82/clazy
  Keywords: Use "clazy style" (without quotation marks) in prompt for the model to kick-in.
  Description:
    "This is Clazy! a new model I trained using Shivam's repo of Dreambooth. Use "clazy style" (without quotation marks) in prompt for the model to kick-in. At the moment need more finetuning, seems to have problems with mouths. Put "open mouth" in the negative prompt to mitigate this effect. It should work with animals too, but since it was trained on human subjects you need to add brackets. Like this for example: [clazy style:10] where 10 is the sample you want the model to kick-in, the first 10 samples will be dedicated to generate some noise of the actual animal. Also you can use this to generate better likeness on some subjects if you aren't satisfied with the results. Use a CFG scale between 3 and 7 to obtain a smoother model, raise the steps number accordingly (between 20 and 50 should be enough)."

Comic Diffusion
  Filename: comic-diffusion.ckpt (also available for 2.x)
  URL: https://huggingface.co/ogkalu/Comic-Diffusion
  Keywords: (charliebo|holliemengert|marioalberti|pepelarraz|andreasrocha|jamesdaly) artstyle
  Description: 
    Trained on 6 styles at once, it allows anyone to create unique but consistent styles by mixing any number of the tokens. Even changing the order of the same list influences results so there's a lot to experiment with here. This was created so anyone could create their comic projects with ease and flexibility. It is the culmination of all my experimentation with dreambooth thus far.

Cyberpunk Anime Diffusion
  Filename: Cyberpunk-Anime-Diffusion.ckpt
  URL: https://huggingface.co/DGSpitzer/Cyberpunk-Anime-Diffusion
  Keywords: After model loaded, use keyword dgs in your prompt, with illustration style to get even better results.
  Description:  
    An AI model that generates cyberpunk anime characters!~

Dreamlike Diffusion
  Filename: dreamlike-diffusion-1.0.ckpt
  URL: https://huggingface.co/dreamlike-art/dreamlike-diffusion-1.0
  Keywords: dreamlikeart
  Description:
    Use the same prompts as you would for SD 1.5. Add dreamlikeart if the artstyle is too weak.
    Non-square aspect ratios work better for some prompts. If you want a portrait photo, try using a 2:3 or a 9:16 aspect ratio. If you want a landscape photo, try using a 3:2 or a 16:9 aspect ratio.
    Use slightly higher resolution for better results: 640x640px, 512x768px, 768x512px, etc.

F222
  Filename: f222.ckpt
  URL: https://huggingface.co/acheong08/f222 (discontinued)
